# Avax 1 Smart Contract Project
The objective of this contract is to be submitted for the AVAX PROOF intermediate course assessment. This will show how to implement some statements.

# Description
This smart contract allows the user to utilize or implement the statements **require()**, **assert()**, and **revert()** on their smart contracts.

# Content Overview
1. **require()**: is employed to verify user input or contract conditions in smart contracts. It makes sure that certain requirements are fulfilled; if not, it raises an exception, reverses the transaction, and uses up all of the gas.
2. **assert()**: is used for internal error checks to identify unexpected conditions that should never occur. It is used for critical invariants that, if violated, indicate a bug in the contract's code.
3. **revert()**: is utilized to give the caller a reason message, gracefully exit a function, and return any remaining gas. In order to manage unusual circumstances without using up all the gas, it is frequently utilized.

# Getting Started
1. Open the source code in REMIX IDE.
2. Compile avax.sol.
3. Use the Deploy & Run Transactions tab.
4. Now use your account address when deploying.
5. Now you can use the features of the Deployed Contracts.
